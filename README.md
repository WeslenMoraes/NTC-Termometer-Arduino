# NTC-Termometer-Arduino
Fácil e barato de fazer, boa precisão

Hi!

Today I made this termometer like one step of my TCC. I used a NTC 10k 3mm and a 10k resistor in series. I took a jumper from positive leg of NTC and put at Arduino A0. I connected the resistor to NTC and to 3V3, and 3V3 connected at AREF.
